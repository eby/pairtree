# pairtree

This project is a php client implementation of [PairTree](https://confluence.ucop.edu/display/Curation/PairTree). It is based heavily on [cbeer's ruby client](https://github.com/cbeer/pairtree). Most of the methods will be of the same name, though it is contained in a single class.

### About PairTree

Pairtree is a filesystem hierarchy for holding objects that are located by mapping identifier strings to object directory (or folder) paths two characters at a time. Pairtrees have the advantage that many object operations, including backup and restore, can be performed with native operating system tools.
